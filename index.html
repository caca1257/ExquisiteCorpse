        <h2> "The Beginning"</h2><p>There once was a small man named Nic. He was a man that communicated to others either with the loudest yell or the quietest whisper: There was no in between. Both a blessing and a curse, Nic was both loved and hated by the members of his community. He was both a legend and an outcast.</p>
        

        <p>
            He was a man marked by his past, after kidnapping the president of the United States and stealing the Declaration of Independence, the World would not forget.

        <p>It's been said that you can hear the faint whispers of nic through the misty cobblestone roads of Chicago. Rumor has it that he is back, and stronger than ever. Nic hasn't been seen since he defeated the hobbits in the
        great battle of Princeton, 1429 AD. Since then, it's been said that Nic spent his time reflecting about his heroic victories on the dark side of the moon. </p>

        <p> Raised in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, some say his patronus is actually himself. He is the true "boy who lived."</p>
